# 🏥 Hospital Face Mask Detection with Live Alert System 😷

A real-time face mask detection system built for hospital environments using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Haar Cascades. This project uses annotated face mask data to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can distinguish between masked and unmasked individuals via webcam and raise alerts.
